## The FrameWork

### 1. Overview

- What type of language is this (OOP VS Procedural VS Functional)

- Do a ``helloworld.new-lang-ext``, It will check the environment is setup and good _scratchpad_ to start playing around

### 2. Syntax Essentials: Types & Variables &  Functions

- Does this language have **types** and are they **required or optional**
- What are the most common **primitive types** (int, string, booleans)
- Basic signature of a function example: keyword `func vs def vs function`
- Pass By Value or Pass By Reference

### 3. Flow Control (If, else, switch etc)
- How todo conditional logic (fancy word for if-statements ~ flow control)
- Looping (while,for etc)



### 4. Classes, Objects, Structs

- Define a class (recipe)
- Create a new Object (Instance) from the Class(recipe)
- Constructors & Destructors

### 5. Common Containers (Example Arrays, Lists, Maps etc)

- Which is the most common container used ? Usually there is one or two dominant ones
- How do I ?
  - add,remove,search item in container
  - iterate over items in container

### 6. Error Handling and Exceptions

- Almost all languages have exceptions, comes down to mostly syntax
  and common best practices

### 7. Standard Lib (Minimal and or Extensive)
- What functions or packages do I need ?
- HTTP ? Curl ? Encoding ?

### 8. Practical EveryDay I/O  (File,DB,Network) ~ It's A Connected World

- HowTo: HTTP Call
- HowTo: JSON decode/encode
- HowTo: DB Query

### Best Practices

- Examples: The Pythonic way, or PHP way. 
- How to write code thats recognizable by community. Style guides  are EXCELLENT for these. 
- Google Has a nice repo of style guides for many languages


### Handy Google/ChatGPT 

- Ask the most common pitfalls or gotchas new ppl coming to language XYZ has
